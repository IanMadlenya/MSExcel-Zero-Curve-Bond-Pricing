# MSExcel-Zero-Curve-Bond-Pricing
This software provides Visual Basic code for bond pricing in Excel using a zero coupon yield curve. It contains counterparts for many of the Excel functions for YTM based bond pricing. The zero curve can be provided either by giving the Nelson Siegel parameters or by giving a table of zero yields at various maturities. In the latter case, the yield curve will be interpolated linearity for intermediate maturities and extrapolated for maturities outside the range.
